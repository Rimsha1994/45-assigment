//Question 30
//Hello Admin: Make a array of five or more usernames, including the name 'admin'.
// Imagine you are writing code that will print a greeting to each user after they log 
//in to a website. Loop through the array, and print a greeting to each user:
//If the username is 'admin', print a special greeting, such as Hello admin, would you like
//to see a status report?
//• Otherwise, print a generic greeting, such as Hello Eric, thank you for logging in again.

let userName: string [] = ["Arsalan","Sohail","Hammad","Haroon","Rabia","Admin"];

 for (let i=0;i<userName.length;i++)

if (userName[i]=="Admin"){

    console.log(`Hello ${userName[i]},would you like to see a status report`)

}else{console.log(`Hello ${userName[i]}, thank you for logging in again`);}
